   using a crystal, mirrors, bowls of water, ink, or flames to induce visions.)

 * <iholsman> if you really want me to go gah gah show link paths of the last X
           users, or last X link paths or some such

 * <iholsman> weed's nice feature is that it does stats by page title.. not just
           the URL

 * <iholsman> and weed is completly remote.. Ie no log parsing.. just uses a web
           bug so I can merge multiple hosts together in one page

 * <iholsman> (or filter by a single host if I want)

 * Fix the javascript for non XMLHttpRequest-enabled browsers
